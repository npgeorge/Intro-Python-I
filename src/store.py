# Build a command-line tool that lets users interact with a store and browse different departments.
#
# The first "page" should look like this:
#
# Welcome to My Fancy Store!
# Departments:
# 1. Shoes
# 2. Pets
# 3. Kitchenware
# 4. Tractors
#
# Choose a department to browse or enter q to exit.
# user chooses 3
# You chose department 3. Kitchenware
# Print a store welcome message w/ the departments
# Take in user input
# Do stuff with the user input
# Repeat until user quits
# Potential Classes
# Department
# User / Customer
# Products
# Registers -- some way of payment?
